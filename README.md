# File System simulation

> A file handling assignment made to teach some ideas about file systems and gain user's experience in C++ file handling.

This assignment was made by [Sudhanshu Vishnoi](https://github.com/sidvishnoi/filesystem-assignment/commits?author=sidvishnoi) and [Rishija Mangla](https://github.com/sidvishnoi/filesystem-assignment/commits?author=Rishija), two students at [Dept. of Computer Science, University of Delhi](http://cs.du.ac.in) during their first year of MCA course under the guidance of Prof. Naveen Kumar.

We have divided the code into several tasks to be done in 6 days. You should read the `README` of each day to understand the tasks.

Each piece of code contains a `%%` symbol with some comments, denoting that you need to write the codes in that section. Make sure that you update the codes day by day. You will be needing the codes of previous day in subsequent days.

To compile the codes, you need `g++` compiler and the `make` utility.

```
$ cd PATH/TO/PROJECT/
